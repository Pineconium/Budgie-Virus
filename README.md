# The *Budgie* Virus
A little WIN3.1 virus I made with VBScript.

The Budgie Virus is meant for Windows 16 bit OS's (mainly the DOS ones.)

It only works in Windows 3.1 as thats the only WIN version I tested.


## Stuff you need.
--For VM's--
1. A virtual machine running Windows 3.1 (or similar 16bit versions) -- *VirtualBox is recommended*
2. The Budgie.img file installed.

--For real hardware (DON'T RECOMMEND!)--
1. A computer or laptop running Windows 3.1 (or similar 16bit versions) -- *This will be the victim*
2. A blank floppy disk (with 1MB of free space)
3. A .img burning software (such as RawWrite)
4. USB Floppy disk writer/reader

## Payload (SPOLLERS!)
Budgie.exe is a basic VBS-based virus made with the Virtual Basic app on Windows 3.1. It's basically gets rid of every thing in the \C:WINDOWS\ directory (excluding the \system\ folder)
